# this file is used to define the standard tests that can be performed on the final dataframe
# unique: Ensures that a column (e.g., launch_id in launches) contains only unique values.
# not_null: Ensures that a column (e.g., launch_id, name, date_utc) does not contain any null values.
# relationships: Ensures referential integrity between the cores table and the launches table.
